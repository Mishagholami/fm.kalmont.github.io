              <h3>Our Mission</h3>
              <p class="space">
                At Kalmont, our mission is to empower outdoor enthusiasts with
                the knowledge and skills needed to safely enjoy mountain
                environments. We believe that education is the foundation of
                wilderness safety, and we are committed to making this education
                accessible to all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through our comprehensive training programs, research
                initiatives, and community outreach, we strive to reduce
                wilderness accidents and foster a culture of responsible outdoor
                recreation. Our team of experienced mountaineers, wilderness
                first responders, and outdoor educators brings decades of
                combined expertise to our programs.

              <h3>Who We Are</h3>
              <p class="space">
                Kalmont was founded in 2005 by a group of mountain guides and
                wilderness educators who recognized the need for specialized
                safety training in alpine environments. What began as a small
                training center has grown into a comprehensive resource for
                mountain safety education, research, and advocacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our team includes certified mountain guides, avalanche
                specialists, wilderness medicine instructors, and environmental
                scientists. This diverse expertise allows us to offer holistic
                safety education that considers not only technical skills but
                also environmental factors and decision-making processes.
